If you would like to contribute, email me at yusefyebra44@gmail.com

Couple things to note:
1. This project is aimed to work on Windows.
  - I do not have access to a macOS or a Linux machine to do this. But if you want to contribute on making the debloater on these systems, leave a request
2. This debloater is not complete.
  - You may have issues running this script, if so, leave a message over on `Issues` and I'll look into it.
  - Some vivo bloat may not be included in this script. If so, leave a feature request over on `Issues` and I'll look into it. Elaborate your request.
